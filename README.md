# Self_Assessment

This final project was probably the most nerve-wracking thing I probably had to do with this whole entire course. Usually group projects always have me worried because at the end of the day, you are relying on random people that are playing a factor to dictate how well you do in the course project. Yes, it was terrifying but frankly, it went pretty smooth for me, which I am blessed for. I would say I did my best helping my team out within my role, even though my job has been very demanding lately since the holiday season is approaching which means more demand for us at work. (I work for heb as a tech specialists). Though, I made sure to communicate with my team what I was going through personally, and tried my best to help out as much as I can. The role I was placed as a triangle I would try to make machine learning models which was a lot tougher for the question we were trying to answer. Me being blessed with a good team, helped me overcome where I would land short at. My team was great, we communicated clearly, we had each others back, and it seem we all liked each other. It was cool meeting my teammates and for them helping me experience how it would likely be switching my career path as a data analysts. Best believe, still got a long way to go, but I feel this was a good step in the right direction.
